# CODSOFT Data Science Internship

Welcome to my CODSOFT Data Science Internship repository! This repository includes the tasks completed as part of the internship program. Below is an overview of each project.

## Tasks

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
**Description:** Developed a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. Features used include age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin.
**Notebook:** [CodSoft_Task_1.ipynb](CodSoft_Task_1.ipynb)

### 2. Movie Rating Prediction
**Description:** Built a model to estimate movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, and actors. Applied regression techniques to analyze and predict movie ratings.
**Notebook:** [CodSoft_Task_2.ipynb](CodSoft_Task_2.ipynb)

### 3. Iris Flower Classification
**Description:** Created a classification model to categorize Iris flowers into species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using sepal and petal measurements.
**Notebook:** [CodSoft_Task_3.ipynb](CodSoft_Task_3.ipynb)

### 4. Sales Prediction
**Description:** Forecasted future sales based on advertising expenditure and target audience segmentation. Focused on optimizing advertising strategies to maximize sales.
**Notebook:** [CodSoft_Task_4.ipynb](CodSoft_Task_4.ipynb)

### 5. Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Description:** Developed a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Included data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, and performance evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
**Notebook:** [CodSoft_Task_5.ipynb](CodSoft_Task_5.ipynb)
